### Holy Sheep V2

Project born as a revision of "holy_sheep", that has now become "holy_sheep_legacy".
At first I just wanted to create a more scalable and correctly functioning version of "holy_sheep", since the first version has been made in more or less 2 days.

At the moment the project is under development, since I wanted to expore the possibility of creating a "GameEngine" in which I can define games rules through a configuration file with defined structure, 
and then let the game engine interpret the config and run the actual game.

You can Docker-compose up the project from the main branch to see the current status of the project
